	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. An efficient algorithm has a time complexity that grows slowly as the input size increases, ensuring quicker execution even for large datasets. Time complexity is often expressed using Big O notation.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the size of its input. It considers both the temporary memory used during execution and the space needed for the input data. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of <i>O(n)</i> means that the memory required grows linearly with the input size.</p>
